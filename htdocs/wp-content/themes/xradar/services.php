                <p>We offer a range of scanning services with a huge variety of applications, from construction, earth sciences, archaeology, to military. Using our own bespoke GPR technology, Xradar, we provide concrete scanning, concrete corrosion mapping, pulse echo, and engineering reporting services across all of Canada.</p>
                <p>As leading service providers, we ensure the highest quality of delivery, guaranteeing your safety and saving you time and money. Using Xradar eliminates the accidental cutting and drilling through embedded objects and the high costs required for repair. It is the safest and most cost effective way to locate objects in concrete structures prior to cutting, coring or drilling.</p>
                <p>Our offices in Victoria, Vancouver, Toronto, Montreal and Quebec City are perfectly placed to serve the needs of clients across the country.</p>
